## Adding realistic shadows to objects and text with the block shadow tool
 
Another feature that can enhance your graphics is the block shadow tool, which allows you to add solid vector shadows to objects and text[^1^]. By reducing the number of lines and nodes in shadows, this tool can speed up your workflow and improve your output quality.
 
To use the block shadow tool, follow these steps:

1. Select an object or text on the canvas.
2. Select the block shadow tool on the toolbox.
3. Drag on the canvas to create a shadow for your object or text.

  ```markdown ![Text with block shadow](shadow.png) ```
