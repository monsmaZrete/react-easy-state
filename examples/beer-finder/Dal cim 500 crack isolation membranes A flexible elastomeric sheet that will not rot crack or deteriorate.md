# How to Use Dal CIM 500 Crack Isolation Membranes for Tile Flooring
  
If you are looking for a durable and effective solution to protect your tile flooring from cracks caused by substrate movement, you may want to consider using Dal CIM 500 crack isolation membranes. These are specially formulated waterproofing membranes that adhere to most materials and form a permanent, seamless barrier to water. They are well suited for plaza and podium decks, curbs, and areas containing multiple penetrations or irregular shapes, as well as split-slab applications.
  
In this article, we will explain what Dal CIM 500 crack isolation membranes are, how they work, and how to use them for your tile flooring project.

## What are Dal CIM 500 Crack Isolation Membranes?
  
Dal CIM 500 crack isolation membranes are composite sheet membranes that consist of a rubberized asphalt core laminated to a high-strength polyethylene film. They are designed to isolate the tile surface from the damaging effects of substrate movement, such as expansion, contraction, or cracking. They can also prevent water intrusion and protect the substrate from deterioration.
  
Dal CIM 500 crack isolation membranes comply with ANSI standard A118.12 for crack isolation performance. They can isolate the tile from in-plane cracks up to 1/8\" (3 mm) in width. They also have low water permeability, high tensile strength, and excellent elongation properties.
  
Dal CIM 500 crack isolation membranes are available in both vertical and horizontal grades. The vertical grade is suitable for walls, columns, and other vertical surfaces. The horizontal grade is suitable for floors, decks, and other horizontal surfaces.
  
## How do Dal CIM 500 Crack Isolation Membranes Work?
  
Dal CIM 500 crack isolation membranes work by providing a flexible layer between the tile and the substrate. This layer absorbs the stress caused by substrate movement and prevents it from transferring to the tile. This way, the tile remains intact and unaffected by cracks in the substrate.

Dal CIM 500 crack isolation membranes also create a waterproof barrier that prevents water from penetrating through the substrate and reaching the tile. This prevents moisture damage, mold growth, and efflorescence on the tile surface.
  
## How to Use Dal CIM 500 Crack Isolation Membranes for Tile Flooring?
  
To use Dal CIM 500 crack isolation membranes for tile flooring, you need to follow these steps:
  
1. Prepare the substrate by cleaning it of any dust, dirt, oil, grease, or other contaminants. Make sure the substrate is dry, smooth, level, and free of any cracks larger than 1/8\" (3 mm). If there are any cracks larger than 1/8\" (3 mm), fill them with a suitable patching compound.
2. Prime the substrate with a compatible primer, such as MAPEI SM Primer Fast or NobleSealant 150. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for application and drying time.
3. Cut the Dal CIM 500 crack isolation membrane to the desired size and shape. Leave a minimum of 2\" (50 mm) overlap at seams and corners.
4. Peel off the release liner from the back of the membrane and apply it to the primed substrate. Press firmly with a roller or a trowel to ensure good adhesion and eliminate any air bubbles or wrinkles.
5. Overlap adjacent sheets of membrane by at least 2\" (50 mm) and bond them together with a compatible seam tape or sealant, such as NobleSealant 150 or Mapeguard Seam Tape.
6. Cover any penetrations or irregular shapes with additional pieces of membrane and seal them with seam tape or sealant.
7. Allow the membrane to cure for at least 24 hours before installing tile over it.
8. Install tile over the membrane using a suitable thin-set mortar, such as MAPEI Ultraflex LFT or NobleBond EXT. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for mixing, application, curing, and grouting.

By following these steps, you can use Dal CIM 500 crack isolation membranes for your tile flooring project and enjoy a long-lasting and crack-free surface.
