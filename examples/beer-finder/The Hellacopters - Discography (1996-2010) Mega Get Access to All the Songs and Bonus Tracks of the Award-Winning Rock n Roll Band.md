The Hellacopters were formed by Nicke Andersson, who was the drummer of the death metal band Entombed, and Dregen, who was the guitarist of the punk rock band Backyard Babies. They recruited Kenny HÃ¥kansson on bass and Robert Eriksson on drums, and later added Boba Fett on keyboards and strings. They released their debut album Supershitty to the Max! in 1996, which won a Swedish Grammy Award for best hard rock album. They followed it with Payin' the Dues in 1997, which featured their signature song "Hopeless Case of a Kid in Denial".
 
In 1998, they signed with Universal Music and released their third album Grande Rock, which marked a shift to a more classic rock sound. They also toured extensively in Europe and the US, opening for bands like Kiss, Aerosmith, and Foo Fighters. In 1999, Dregen left the band to focus on Backyard Babies, and was replaced by Chuck Pounder. The band released their fourth album High Visibility in 2000, which was their most successful album commercially and critically. It included the hit singles "Toys and Flavors" and "By the Grace of God".
 
The band continued to experiment with different styles and influences on their fifth album By the Grace of God in 2002, which featured guest appearances by Scott Morgan and The Soundtrack of Our Lives. They also released a live album Live at Cirkus in 2003, which captured their performance at the Stockholm venue. In 2004, they released their sixth album Rock & Roll Is Dead, which was a return to their garage rock roots. They also added Anders LindstrÃ¶m on guitar and keyboards, making them a six-piece band.
 
The band announced their breakup in 2007, citing creative differences and personal issues. They released their seventh and final album Head Off in 2008, which consisted of cover songs by their favorite bands and artists. They also embarked on a farewell tour called The Tour Before the Fall, which ended with a sold-out show at Debaser Medis in Stockholm on October 26, 2008. The band played their last song "Gotta Get Some Action Now!" and thanked their fans for their support.
 
The Hellacopters have left a lasting legacy as one of the most influential and respected rock bands in Sweden and beyond. They have inspired many other bands and musicians with their style and attitude, such as The Hives, Danko Jones, Turbonegro, and Imperial State Electric. They have also been praised by legends like Lemmy Kilmister, Iggy Pop, Alice Cooper, and Dave Grohl. They have been described as "the best rock & roll band in the world" by Rolling Stone magazine.
