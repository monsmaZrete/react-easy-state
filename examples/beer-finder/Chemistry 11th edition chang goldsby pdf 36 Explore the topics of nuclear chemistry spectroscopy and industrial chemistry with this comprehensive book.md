The 11th edition has some new features and changes compared to the previous editions. For example, the chapter order has been rearranged, with nuclear chemistry moving up in the sequence. There is also a new problem type called Interpreting, Modeling, and Estimating, which demonstrates what a real life chemist does on a daily basis. The authors have added over 340 new problems to the book, covering various levels of difficulty and topics. Moreover, the book incorporates real examples and helps students visualize the three-dimensional atomic and molecular structures that are the basis of chemical activity. The book also aims to develop students' problem-solving and critical thinking skills.
 
The book is divided into 25 chapters, covering topics such as atoms, molecules, stoichiometry, reactions, thermochemistry, quantum theory, periodicity, bonding, gases, liquids, solids, solutions, kinetics, equilibrium, acids and bases, buffers and titrations, solubility and complexation equilibria, thermodynamics, electrochemistry, nuclear chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, chemistry of the elements, coordination compounds and metals. Each chapter begins with an introduction that outlines the main objectives and concepts. The chapters also include worked examples with detailed solutions, conceptual questions with answers, exercises with answers at the end of the book, key terms with definitions and summaries with main points.
 
The book is accompanied by various online resources for both students and instructors. For students, there are interactive tutorials, animations, simulations, quizzes and practice tests. For instructors, there are PowerPoint slides, lecture outlines, test banks and solutions manuals. The book also has an online homework system called Connect Chemistry that provides instant feedback and personalized learning.
 
Chemistry 11th edition by Chang and Goldsby is a comprehensive and well-written textbook that covers the essential topics of general chemistry in an engaging and accessible way. It is suitable for students who want to learn the fundamentals of chemistry as well as prepare for more advanced courses or careers in science.
  
One of the strengths of Chemistry 11th edition by Chang and Goldsby is the integration of effective technology throughout the book and its online resources. The book uses a variety of tools to enhance the learning experience and facilitate the understanding of complex concepts. For example, the book has QR codes that link to videos, animations and simulations that illustrate key concepts and phenomena. The book also has ChemWork problems that require students to use online molecular modeling software to solve problems involving molecular structures and properties. The book also has Connect Chemistry, an online homework system that provides instant feedback and personalized learning paths for students.
 
Another strength of Chemistry 11th edition by Chang and Goldsby is the emphasis on developing students' problem-solving and critical thinking skills. The book has a clear and consistent problem-solving strategy that guides students through the steps of analyzing, planning, solving and checking their solutions. The book also has a variety of problem types that challenge students to apply their knowledge, interpret data, model situations and estimate results. The book also has conceptual questions that test students' understanding of the main concepts and principles. The book also has exercises that reinforce the skills and concepts learned in each chapter.
 
A possible weakness of Chemistry 11th edition by Chang and Goldsby is the lack of diversity and inclusion in some aspects of the book. The book does not have many examples or images that reflect the diversity of people and cultures involved in chemistry. The book also does not have many topics or applications that relate to social or environmental issues that are relevant to chemistry. The book could benefit from more attention to these aspects to make chemistry more engaging and relevant for a wider range of students.
